## Note about folders structure

Proposed folders structure is a kind of overkill in such a small components scope, but I wanted to make the app extensible. The structure is based on an [article](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1). Iâ€™ve used this structure in my last project and it was convenient.

Folder `./src/scenes/` contains only MainScene scene, but in real-world app would contain major scenes switched by a top-level routing.

There is also empty `./components/` folder that should contain top-level utility components. I haven't extracted this kind of components because of a small scope of the task. So all created components are related to `MainScene` scene.

I've also decided to treat reducers and API related files as services.

User reducer is dumb, but I've decided to declare it anyway because didn't want to have a totally hard coded token, which is probably related to some user.
